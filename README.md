# 2025 Diamond Dollars Competition

### Collaborators: Brett Cerenzio, Aidan Gurvitch, Danielle Napierski, Zach Silverstein, Dylan Stafeil

- This year, we were tasked with recreating the Save statistic and to create a new reliever stat that better evaluates the unique role of a reliever
- Evaluated which relievers performed the best using our Leverage Performance Above Expected Metric (LPAA), taking into account both the leverage & expected runs allowed in a given PA
- Evaluated which relievers performed best in a given outing based on the initial base-out state they came into (RSAE & xRSAE)
